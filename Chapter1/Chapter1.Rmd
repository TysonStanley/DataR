This document is an RMarkdown document. This right here is nothing more than text. The stuff below is what is known as a code chunk. Everything between the top ticks (<code>```</code>) is R code.

```{r}
#install.packages("rio") ## uncomment this line to install rio
df <- rio::import("OfficeParks.csv")
df
```

Below is code to check out the data frame.

```{r}
str(df)
names(df)
summary(df)
```
